    <!-- I asked Chat GPT to give me some fun facts about the earth and the moon for the AI generated descriptions. -->
    <p>The Moon, Earth’s only natural satellite, is about one-fourth the size of Earth and orbits our planet at an average distance of 238,855 miles. Formed about 4.5 billion years ago, scientists believe the Moon originated when a Mars-sized object collided with Earth, ejecting material into space that coalesced to form the Moon. The Moon’s surface is covered with craters caused by meteor impacts, as it lacks an atmosphere to shield it from space debris.
        The Moon is responsible for Earth’s tides through its gravitational pull, which affects ocean levels and currents. Unlike Earth, the Moon is geologically inactive, with no volcanic or tectonic activity, making its surface almost unchanged for billions of years. Temperatures on the Moon range from 260°F during the day to -280°F at night because it lacks an atmosphere to regulate heat. Its gravity is only one-sixth that of Earth’s, so a person weighing 150 pounds on Earth would weigh just 25 pounds on the Moon, making moonwalking a real phenomenon!</p>
