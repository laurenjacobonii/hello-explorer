    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and is about 4.5 billion years old. It’s responsible for Earth’s tides and always shows the same face due to synchronous rotation. Did you know the Moon has no atmosphere, so its surface temperature varies from 260°F during the day to -280°F at night? The Moon’s gravity is only one-sixth of Earth’s, making jumping there much easier!</p>
