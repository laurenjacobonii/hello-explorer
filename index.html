    <!-- I asked Chat GPT to give me some fun facts about the earth and the moon for the AI generated descriptions. -->
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known place in the universe that supports life. Covering over 70% of its surface, Earth’s oceans are vital in regulating its climate and supporting diverse ecosystems. The Earth’s atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, protects us from harmful solar radiation and keeps the planet warm enough to sustain life.
        Did you know that Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing? This phenomenon is caused by the Moon's gravitational pull, which creates tidal friction. Over millions of years, this has slightly lengthened our days. Earth also has a molten iron core, which generates a powerful magnetic field that deflects dangerous solar winds. Orbiting the Sun at an average speed of 67,000 miles per hour, it takes Earth exactly 365.25 days to complete one orbit—hence, we add a leap day every four years to align our calendars with this orbit.</p>
