    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth is the only planet known to support life, with 71% of its surface covered by water. It has a perfect balance of gravity to hold an atmosphere and is the third planet from the Sun. Did you know Earth orbits the Sun at a speed of 67,000 miles per hour? Its molten core generates a magnetic field that protects us from harmful solar radiation.</p>
